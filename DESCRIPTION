Description:
  Broadly useful convenient and efficient R functions
  that bring users concise and elegant R data analyses.
  This package includes easy-to-use functions for
  (1) basic R programming
  (e.g., set working directory to where the current file is,
  print strings with rich formats and colors);
  (2) multivariate computation
  (e.g., compute scale sums/means/... with reverse scoring);
  (3) reliability and factor analyses;
  (4) descriptive statistics and correlation analyses;
  (5) multi-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA),
  simple-effect analysis, and post-hoc multiple comparison;
  (6) tidy report of regression models (to Console and to Word);
  (7) mediation and moderation analyses;
  and (8) additional toolbox for statistics and graphics.
