## News

In this version (0.7.0), I have added two new functions `PROCESS()` and `lavaan_summary()`, improved many functions, and fixed a bug in the last update ("ERROR" for "r-devel-linux-*", a problem newly emerging on 2021-05-25, as notified by Kurt Hornik).

* Windows 10 (local installation), R 4.0.5
* Mac OS 11.2 (user installation), R 4.0.4
* Ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci.com), R 4.0.2
