## News
In this version (0.8.0), I have added, fixed, and improved many functions (almost all functions have been improved, for their functionality and/or help page). Package dependencies have also been changed, for faster and more robust installation.

I have fixed "Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION" in the last submission.


## Test environments

* Windows 10 (local installation), R 4.1.2
* Mac OS 11.2 (user installation), R 4.0.4
* Ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci.com), R 4.0.2


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes


## Reverse dependencies

Checks on the one downstream dependency (`ChineseNames`) found no problems.
